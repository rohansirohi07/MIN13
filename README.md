# 🌍 AQI Prediction & Air Quality Analytics System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction System** that predicts air quality levels based on major air pollutants. The system also provides **analytics and report generation** to help understand pollution trends.

The prediction is performed using **machine learning models**, and the application allows users to input real-world pollutant values to get instant AQI results.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict **AQI value** based on pollutant concentrations
- Analyze air quality trends
- Generate reports for better decision-making
- Provide a simple and interactive interface for users

---

## 🧪 Pollutants Used for Prediction
The AQI prediction is based on the following parameters:

- **SO₂ (Sulphur Dioxide)**
- **NO₂ (Nitrogen Dioxide)**
- **CO (Carbon Monoxide)**
- **PM2.5 (Fine Particulate Matter)**
- **PM10 (Coarse Particulate Matter)**
- **O₃ (Ozone)** *(optional if included)*
